## About

Mobile (Android) version of my game [Vaporbreaker](https://github.com/williamdsw/vaporbreaker). 
Personally I think it's fits better the layout and design instead of the desktop version.

## Built with

* Unity
* C#
* Adobe Photoshop CS6
* GIMP
* Audacity

## Running the project locally

* Download `.zip` file or `git clone` this repo.
* Make sure that you have version `2020.1.15f1` of Unity or more recent one.
* Open `Unity Hub` and import the project (`Target Plataform = Android`).
* Open the `Logo Screen` scene, and hit the play button.

## Where to play

* [App in Google Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.retrogemn.vaporbreaker)
